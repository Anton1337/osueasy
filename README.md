# osueasy

## Current release: v0.1.2

> **_NOTE:_** This library is basically a wrapper for [Bancho.js](https://github.com/ThePooN/bancho.js) to simplify creation of specific bancho applications. If you need more advanced/custom functionality, please use [Bancho.js](https://github.com/ThePooN/bancho.js) instead. It's very well made.

# Introduction

Easy osu bancho interfacing

# Disclaimer

Running an IRC bot on your osu! account for development purposes is fine, however once it enters production, it is advised to [contact the osu! staff](mailto:contact@ppy.sh) to detail the purpose of your bot and get authorization. Keep in mind you aren't allowed to create a dedicated osu! account to your bot neither. **Any attempt to do so without authorization from the staff will be considered multi-accounting, which is against the osu! Terms of Use.**
